# airBuddy v2  
**Open‑source air quality testing for one's home and community**

---

## Overview

**airBuddy** is a small, open‑source air quality testing device.  Version 2.1 is built on a **Raspberry Pi Zero 2 W**.  
The airBuddy let's one test and track the air quality in one's home-- and later one's community.   The project uses super inexpensive and sensor components that are available just about anywhere, so that just about anyone can put it togeter.

With one press of a button, airBuddy:
- Measures **temperature & humidity**
- Reads **eCO₂ (equivalent CO₂)** and **TVOC (total volatile organic compounds)**
- Estimates overall **air quality**
- Displays the results on a compact OLED screen
- Logs readings to a local data file for long‑term tracking

The goal is simple:

> **If people can measure their air, they can demand better air.**

airBuddy is designed to be:
- Affordable
- Hackable
- Community‑deployable
- Fully open source



## AirBuddy Roadmap

A quick snapshot of where AirBuddy has been — and where it’s heading next.

- ✅ **AirBuddy 1.0 — Raspberry Pi Zero**  
  First working prototype. Proof of concept achieved.

- ❌ **AirBuddy 2.0 — ESP32**  
  Attempted redesign. Architecture and constraints didn’t hold up.

- 🚧 **AirBuddy 2.1 — Raspberry Pi Pico**  
  Current active build. Modular sensors, cleaner power, tighter firmware.

- ✅ **AirBuddy 3D-Printed Casing**  
  Functional enclosure completed and tested.

- 🚧 **AirBuddy Wooden Casing**  
  Handcrafted, natural-material enclosure in development.

- ⏭ **AirBuddy 2.2 — ESP32 (Revisited)**  
  Planned revisit with lessons learned from Pico architecture.

- 🟡 **air.earthen.io API — Data Logging & Sync**  
  Backend logging system initiated; schema and endpoints underway.

- 🟡 **air.earthen.io Home Dashboard**  
  Backend logging system initiated; schema and endpoints underway.

- 🟡 **air.earthen.io Community Dashboard**  
  Backend logging system initiated; schema and endpoints underway.
